# Data Structure and Algorithm

This is a repsitory for storing my code for the HCMUT's DSA course

## This repository will store

> - Code for Labs
>
> - Code for assignment
>
> - Code for algorithm and structure that I learnt on school
>
> - Additional mid-term and end-term tests, as well as document that I write during the course

_Lastly, there will also be some advices for what should you preperare for those exams_

_Please note that not every code will be provided, the repository is primarily a personal space for store my code!_

```python

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
